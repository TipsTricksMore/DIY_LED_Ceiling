Controller:
Raspberry Pi  - running: LEDCeilingControllerPythonRPi.py

Arduino Mega  - running: LEDCeilingArduinoControllerArduinoMega.ino

Arduino Micro - running: LEDCeilingRotaryEncoderFinal.ino

(The serial output is being fed to the RPi via USB)

LED's are driven by an ESP32 at each row running WLED (https://github.com/Aircoookie/WLED)

I'm not able to work further on this project and dont have time to solve issues. 
Try your best to edit the code and make it fit your needs :)

Have Fun! 

Best,

Leo
